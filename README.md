# Texas-Loan-Payment-Calculation-Program
This program is part of my data structures and algorithms lab for Fall 2024, the first lab assigned to the class.
This lab satisfied the B option for the assignment. The final score for my lab was an 85%. 

This program was written in the Ada language, which is used by the U.S. Department of Defense. It emphasizes strong typing, safety, real-time systems support, and readability.
